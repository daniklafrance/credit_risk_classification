# credit_risk_classification

## Description

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Getting Started

#### The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Setup

* numpy 1.21.6
* pandas 1.0.5
* scikit-learn 1.0.2
* imbalanced-learn 0.11.0

## Dependencies

* import numpy as np
* import pandas as pd
* from pathlib import Path
* from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
* from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler

## Grading

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets (30 points)
* Create a Logistic Regression Model (30 points)
* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report (20 points)
* Coding Conventions and Formatting (10 points)
* Code Comments (10 points)
